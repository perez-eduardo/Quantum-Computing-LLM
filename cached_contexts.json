Could be an electron spin, photon polarization, or superconducting circuit. The physical form varies but the math is the same. Q: What is a qubit? A: A qubit, short for quantum bit, is the basic unit of information in quantum computing. Unlike a classical bit that can only be 0 or 1, a qubit can be 0, 1, or both at the same time thanks to a property called superposition. This is what gives quantum computers their potential power.
