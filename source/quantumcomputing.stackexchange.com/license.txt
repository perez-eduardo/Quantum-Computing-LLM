The CC BY-SA licensing, while intentionally permissive, does require
attribution:

Attribution — You must attribute the work in the manner specified by 
the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they 
endorse you or your use of the work). If you republish this content, 
we require that you:

1. Visually indicate that the content is from the Stack Exchange site 
   it had originated from in some way.
2. Hyperlink directly to the original question on the source site (e.g. 
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12345).
3. Show the author name for every question and answer.
4. Hyperlink each author name directly back to their user profile page
   on the source site (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/users/123/username).

By "directly," we mean each hyperlink must point directly to our domain
in standard HTML visible even with JavaScript disabled, and not use a 
tinyurl or any other form of obfuscation or redirection. Furthermore, 
the links cannot be marked with the nofollow attribute.

This is about the spirit of fair attribution: to the website and, more
importantly, to the individuals who generously contributed their time
and knowledge to create that content in the first place.
