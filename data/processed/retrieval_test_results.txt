protected by the code.
Not all noisy channels can be interpreted so easily as a random combination of no
error, bit ﬂips, phase ﬂips and combinations of the two. Many naturally occurring quan-
tum channels have no such interpretation. Consider the example of amplitude damping
(Section 8.3.5), which has operation elements E0 and E1:
√1 −γ

The parameter γ is a small positive parameter characterizing the strength of the ampli-

B = exp

a, a† and b, b† are annihilation and creation operators for photons in the two modes. The
output after the beamsplitter, assuming the environment starts out with no photons, is
simply B|0⟩(a|0⟩+b|1⟩) = a|00⟩+b(cos θ|01⟩+sin θ|10⟩), using Equation (7.34). Tracing
over the environment gives us the quantum operation

operator-sum representation for the process contains a large
identity component. Intuitively it seems reasonable that in such a circumstance error-
correction should result in a net gain in the storage ﬁdelity for quantum information,
provided the noise is sufﬁciently weak. We will now show that this is in fact the case,
using the speciﬁc example of the amplitude damping channel for concreteness. A simple
calculation shows that the minimum ﬁdelity for the amplitude damping channel applied

So, the amplitudes of |01⟩and |10⟩are swapped, as expected.
As a quantum circuit, we can draw a SWAP gate using a vertical line with ×’s
at each end, or by literally swapping the wires:
In Quirk, “Swap” is located in the top Toolbox under “Half Turns”:

We also included an X gate so that the top qubit is a |1⟩. This swaps with the
bottom qubit, which then swaps with the middle qubit, so the result is that the

to one triplet. In the middle section, you should add the previously given circuit. As described in
Exercise 4.45, postselect on |0⟩as a workaround for resetting the ancilla qubits. In the last section
of the circuit, we undo the Shor encoding and Hadamard gate so that all the qubits are |0⟩again.
Verify that your circuit does this. Try moving the Zt gate around to different triplets to ensure that

the same phonon is shared by all the ions, since it is a center-of-mass phonon; because
of this, adopting engineering terminology, this has been called the phonon ‘bus’ qubit in

Suppose we label this code C and deﬁne C1 ≡C and C2 ≡C⊥. To use these codes to

of entanglement transformation, known as entanglement distillation and entanglement
dilution. The idea of entanglement distillation is for Alice and Bob to convert some
large number of copies of a known pure state |ψ⟩into as many copies of the Bell state
2 as possible using local operations and classical communication, requiring
not that they succeed exactly, but only with high ﬁdelity. Entanglement dilution is the
reverse process of using LOCC to convert a large number of copies of t

the quantity of entanglement; we will see that for pure states |ψ⟩the entanglement of
formation and the distillable entanglement are in fact exactly the same!
Let’s take a look at a simple protocol for entanglement dilution, and another for

jukebox doesn't allow for minute adjustments. You can't set it to level 2.5 or
3.8. Only whole numbers, discrete levels of volume: 1, 2, 3, and so on.
This is much akin to quantized energy levels in quantum mechanics. Atoms
and their electrons don't have a continuous energy spectrum. Instead, they
can only exist in certain, fixed energy states. Much like the jukebox, there's
no "in-between."

the Bloch sphere representation of the qubit is shown, and the state is a point at the
north pole, as expected.
Now if we apply the X gate, Quirk shows the following:
Note Quirk uses ⊕to denote a single X gate, whereas we use X (later, we will
also use ⊕when the X gate is controlled by another qubit). Since X|0⟩= |1⟩, the
probability of measuring |1⟩is 1. This is labeled as “On,” and the Bloch sphere now
shows the state at the south pole, as expected.

Challenges in Achieving High-Fidelity Qubit Operations
In quantum computing, achieving high-fidelity qubit operations is one of
the most formidable challenges. Think of fidelity in this context as the
trustworthiness of a qubit to execute its job accurately. Just as an expert
pianist strives for each note to be pitch-perfect in a concert, we desire each

We can turn to the DiVincenzo criteria we described in chapter 2 to
aid us in this test. For example, DiVincenzo calls for the qubits to
be individually addressable in a quantum computer. If we have, for
example, a two-level system comprised of an ensemble of atoms, but
where the qubits are not individually addressable, this system would
fail the QC test.
