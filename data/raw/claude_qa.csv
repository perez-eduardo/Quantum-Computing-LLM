They are commonly used for state preparation since they can reach any point on the Bloch sphere combined with R_z.
What is an R_z rotation gate?,"An R_z gate rotates the qubit state around the Z axis of the Bloch sphere by a specified angle. This only changes the relative phase between 0 and 1, not measurement probabilities. R_z gates are often easy to implement in hardware or can be done virtually through frame tracking."
What are virtual Z gates?,"Virtual Z gates are R_z rotations implemented by changing the reference frame of subsequent pulses rather than applying a physical operation. Since Z rotations only change phase, they can be absorbed into future gates. This makes Z rotations essentially free in many systems."
What is frame tracking?,Frame tracking keeps track of accumulated Z rotations that are applied virtually rather than physically. The control software adjusts the phase of all subsequent pulses to account for virtual rotations. This optimization eliminates the need for physical Z gate pulses.
How do you decompose arbitrary single-qubit gates?,"Any single-qubit gate can be decomposed into a sequence of rotations. One common decomposition is Z-Y-Z: any single-qubit operation equals R_z times R_y times R_z for appropriate angles. Alternatively, R_x and R_z combinations also suffice."
What is the ZYZ decomposition?,"The ZYZ decomposition expresses any single-qubit gate as three rotations: first R_z by some angle, then R_y by another angle, then R_z by a third angle. This is useful because hardware often has native R_z (or virtual Z) and R_y operations."
What is the U3 gate?,U3 is a general single-qubit gate parameterized by three angles. It can implement any single-qubit operation. Many quantum frameworks use U3 as the universal single-qubit gate from which others are derived. IBM's Qiskit historically used U3 as a primitive.

What is a cosine pulse shape?,"Cosine or raised cosine pulse shapes smoothly ramp up and down with cosine profiles. Like Gaussian shapes, they reduce spectral leakage compared to rectangular pulses. Different pulse shapes trade off gate speed, fidelity, and leakage characteristics."
What is pulse bandwidth?,"Pulse bandwidth is the range of frequencies present in a control pulse. Shorter pulses have larger bandwidth. If bandwidth exceeds the qubit anharmonicity, unwanted transitions to higher levels occur. Pulse shaping controls bandwidth to minimize leakage while maintaining speed."
What is spectral leakage?,Spectral leakage means frequency components of a pulse extending beyond the intended range. Sharp pulse edges create broad frequency spread. This can drive unwanted transitions in qubits with nearby energy levels. Smooth pulse shaping reduces spectral leakage.

What is gate time versus fidelity tradeoff?,Shorter gates reduce decoherence but may have lower control fidelity due to bandwidth limitations and leakage. Longer gates allow more precise control but suffer more decoherence. Optimal gate time balances these competing factors for maximum overall fidelity.
What determines minimum gate time?,Minimum gate time is limited by the qubit's response to control fields and constraints on spectral content. Faster pulses require stronger drives and broader bandwidth. The qubit's anharmonicity sets a speed limit for avoiding leakage.
How do calibration drifts affect single-qubit gates?,"Calibration drift causes gradual degradation of gate fidelity over time. Qubit frequencies shift, pulse amplitudes vary, and timing relationships change. Regular recalibration or continuous tracking maintains gate quality despite drifts."

How does the CNOT gate work mathematically?,"CNOT maps the two-qubit basis states as: 00 stays 00, 01 stays 01, 10 becomes 11, and 11 becomes 10. In matrix form, it is a 4x4 permutation matrix. The effect is XOR: the target qubit becomes the XOR of control and original target."
What is the control qubit?,"The control qubit determines whether an operation is applied to the target. If the control is in state 0, nothing happens to the target. If the control is 1, the specified operation is applied. In diagrams, the control is shown as a filled dot on the circuit wire."
What is the target qubit?,"The target qubit receives the conditional operation in a controlled gate. When the control condition is met, the operation transforms the target. In circuit diagrams, the target is shown with the operation symbol like a plus circle for CNOT."
What is the CZ gate and how does it differ from CNOT?,"The CZ gate applies a Z operation when both qubits are in state 1, adding a minus sign to the 11 state only. Unlike CNOT, CZ is symmetric between the two qubits. CZ is equivalent to CNOT with Hadamard gates on the target before and after."
Why is CZ symmetric?,"CZ only affects the 11 state, treating both qubits identically. Neither qubit is distinguished as control or target in the effect. This symmetry can simplify circuit design and analysis. The symmetry reflects the mathematical structure of the controlled-Z operation."
How do you convert between CNOT and CZ?,"CNOT equals CZ with Hadamard gates on the target: H on target, then CZ, then H on target gives CNOT. Conversely, CZ equals Hadamard-CNOT-Hadamard. This equivalence lets you use whichever gate your hardware provides natively."
How does SWAP move quantum information?,"SWAP exchanges the complete quantum states of two qubits, including all superposition and phase information. After SWAP, each qubit holds what the other previously held. This enables routing information across chips with limited connectivity where not all qubits can directly interact."
How do you decompose SWAP into CNOTs?,"SWAP equals three alternating CNOTs: CNOT with A controlling B, then CNOT with B controlling A, then CNOT with A controlling B again. This sequence exchanges the qubit states. The decomposition shows SWAP is not a primitive entangling gate."
How is iSWAP different from regular SWAP?,"While regular SWAP simply exchanges qubit states, iSWAP adds a phase factor of i during the exchange. This phase makes iSWAP a native entangling gate for some superconducting systems. Two iSWAP operations equal one SWAP, but a single iSWAP creates entanglement that plain SWAP does not."
What is the square root of SWAP?,"The square root of SWAP is a gate that, applied twice, gives SWAP. It creates partial entanglement between qubits and is a natural operation for some physical systems. Square root of SWAP plus single-qubit gates is universal for quantum computation."

What is the controlled-Z gate different from applying Z?,"Applying Z to one qubit only affects that qubit's phase. The controlled-Z affects the joint state, adding phase only when both qubits are 1. This creates entanglement because the phase depends on the combined state, not individual qubits."
Why is the Toffoli gate important for reversible computing?,"The Toffoli gate is universal for classical reversible computation, meaning any Boolean function can be built from Toffoli gates. Since quantum computation must be reversible, Toffoli provides a bridge between classical and quantum logic. It enables implementing classical subroutines within quantum algorithms."
How many CNOT gates to implement Toffoli?,The standard Toffoli decomposition uses six CNOT gates plus several single-qubit gates including T gates. Optimized decompositions can reduce this depending on the native gate set. The significant overhead makes Toffoli expensive in near-term quantum circuits.
How is Fredkin gate used in quantum circuits?,"The Fredkin or controlled-SWAP gate conditionally exchanges two qubits based on a third control qubit. It appears in quantum algorithms for comparison operations and can implement any classical reversible function. Like Toffoli, Fredkin must be decomposed into simpler native gates for most hardware."

What determines two-qubit gate fidelity?,"Two-qubit gate fidelity depends on the coherence of both qubits during the gate, the accuracy of control pulses, residual ZZ coupling or other unwanted interactions, and measurement errors in characterization. Two-qubit fidelities are typically lower than single-qubit fidelities."
Why are two-qubit gates harder than single-qubit?,"Two-qubit gates require coupling qubits in a controlled way, which introduces additional error mechanisms. Both qubits must remain coherent during the interaction. Unwanted couplings and crosstalk affect both qubits. The operation involves more complex physics than single-qubit rotations."
What is the ZZ interaction?,ZZ interaction is a coupling where the energy depends on whether both qubits are in state 1. Always-on ZZ coupling between qubits causes unwanted phase accumulation. Managing ZZ is important for high-fidelity two-qubit gates and reducing idle errors.
What is residual ZZ coupling?,Residual ZZ coupling is unwanted always-on interaction between qubits that persists even when gates are not being applied. It causes phase errors during idle time and affects gate calibration. Reducing or compensating residual ZZ improves circuit fidelity.
What is echo ZZ?,Echo ZZ is a technique to cancel accumulated phase from ZZ coupling by inserting refocusing pulses. The echo reverses phase accumulation from the first half of the idle period. This reduces errors from residual ZZ without eliminating the coupling itself.
What is the cross-resonance gate mechanism?,Cross-resonance drives one qubit at the frequency of a coupled neighbor. The drive effect on the second qubit depends on the first qubit's state due to their coupling. This conditional rotation creates entanglement. IBM systems commonly use cross-resonance gates.
How does cross-resonance create entanglement?,"When qubit A is driven at qubit B's frequency, B experiences a rotation whose direction depends on A's state. If A is in 0, B rotates one way; if A is in 1, B rotates the opposite way. This state-dependent rotation entangles the qubits."
What is the echoed cross-resonance gate?,"Echoed cross-resonance adds X gates that refocus unwanted single-qubit rotations during the CR pulse. The echo cancels some error terms, improving fidelity. Most practical cross-resonance implementations use echoing to achieve higher gate quality."
What determines cross-resonance gate speed?,Cross-resonance gate speed depends on the coupling strength between qubits and the drive amplitude. Stronger coupling or stronger drives give faster gates but may increase leakage. Detuning between qubits also affects the achievable gate rate.
What is the flux-tunable coupler for two-qubit gates?,A flux-tunable coupler is a circuit element between qubits whose coupling strength can be adjusted with magnetic flux. Turning coupling on for gates and off otherwise reduces idle errors and crosstalk. This enables high-fidelity two-qubit gates with better isolation.
How do parametric gates work?,"Parametric gates modulate a circuit element at a frequency that activates qubit-qubit coupling. The modulation drives transitions that exchange excitations between qubits, creating entanglement. Parametric activation enables fast gates while keeping coupling off during idle times."
What is the frequency of parametric modulation?,"Parametric modulation frequency is typically the sum or difference of qubit frequencies, matching the energy needed for excitation exchange. The specific frequency depends on the desired gate type. Precise frequency control is essential for selective gate activation."
What is the all-microwave approach to two-qubit gates?,All-microwave gates use only microwave control pulses without flux tuning. Cross-resonance is an all-microwave technique. This approach avoids flux-sensitive elements that introduce noise but may have slower gates or other constraints.
What is a flux pulse for two-qubit gates?,A flux pulse temporarily changes a qubit's frequency by adjusting magnetic flux through its SQUID loop. Bringing qubits into resonance or near specific transitions enables two-qubit gates. Flux pulses must be fast and well-shaped to avoid leakage.
What is the CZ gate via avoided crossing?,"Near avoided crossings, bringing two qubits into resonance creates a CZ gate through the interaction at the crossing. The system picks up a phase when both qubits are excited. Careful flux pulse design achieves this while avoiding leakage to non-computational states."
What is leakage in two-qubit gates?,"Leakage during two-qubit gates populates states outside the computational subspace. Transitions to higher transmon levels or two-qubit states beyond 00, 01, 10, 11 cause leakage. Gate pulse design must avoid these unwanted transitions while achieving the desired operation."
How do you reduce two-qubit gate leakage?,"Reducing leakage involves careful pulse shaping, avoiding resonances with leakage transitions, and using techniques like DRAG adapted for two-qubit gates. Longer gates have less bandwidth and less leakage but suffer more decoherence. Optimal pulse design balances these factors."

What is a maximally entangling gate?,"A maximally entangling gate can create a Bell state from a product state. Gates like CNOT, CZ, iSWAP, and the MS gate at appropriate angles are maximally entangling. Maximum entanglement means the gate produces maximum quantum correlations."
What is a universal gate set?,"A universal gate set is a collection of gates that can approximate any quantum operation to arbitrary precision. A common universal set includes all single-qubit gates plus CNOT. Alternatively, Hadamard, T, and CNOT form a discrete universal set. Universality means any algorithm can be compiled to these gates."
Why does Hadamard plus T plus CNOT form a universal set?,Hadamard and T together can approximate any single-qubit rotation through repeated application. Adding CNOT provides the entangling capability. The Solovay-Kitaev theorem guarantees that any target operation can be approximated efficiently using these discrete gates.
What gates form the Clifford group?,"The Clifford group consists of gates that map Pauli operators to Pauli operators under conjugation. It includes Hadamard, S, and CNOT as generators. Clifford gates alone are not universal and can be efficiently simulated classically, but adding T gates achieves universality."
Why are Clifford gates efficiently simulable?,Clifford gates acting on stabilizer states can be tracked using the stabilizer formalism without exponential overhead. The Gottesman-Knill theorem proves this classical simulation is efficient. This is why adding non-Clifford gates like T is necessary for quantum advantage.
What is the Gottesman-Knill theorem?,"The Gottesman-Knill theorem states that quantum circuits using only Clifford gates, starting from computational basis states, and measuring in the computational basis can be efficiently simulated classically. This identifies the boundary where quantum speedup requires non-Clifford resources."
What makes the T gate special?,"The T gate is the simplest non-Clifford gate and is essential for universality. It cannot be implemented transversally in most error-correcting codes, making fault-tolerant T gates expensive. The T gate count often determines the cost of fault-tolerant algorithms."
What is the distinction between Clifford and non-Clifford gates?,"Clifford gates preserve the Pauli group structure and are classically simulable. Non-Clifford gates like T break this structure, enabling quantum advantage. The overhead of fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates makes minimizing their count an optimization priority."
What is a discrete universal gate set?,"A discrete universal gate set contains only finitely many distinct gates yet can approximate any operation. Hadamard, T, and CNOT form such a set. Discrete sets are important for fault-tolerant computing where only certain gates can be implemented reliably."

Why do different hardware platforms have different native gates?,Native gates depend on the physical interactions available. Superconducting systems might have native CZ while trapped ions have native XX gates. Hardware designers choose gates that are naturally high-fidelity for their system. Compilers translate algorithms to native gates.
How many two-qubit gates to implement a three-qubit gate?,Implementing arbitrary three-qubit gates requires multiple two-qubit gates. Toffoli needs six CNOTs in standard decomposition. General three-qubit gates need about twenty two-qubit gates. This overhead motivates finding efficient decompositions for common operations.

What is circuit depth as a complexity measure?,"Circuit depth counts the number of sequential time steps, where parallel gates count as one step. Depth determines runtime and exposure to decoherence. Shallow circuits are preferred when coherence time limits computation, even if they use more total gates."
How do gate count and depth trade off?,"Parallelizing gates can reduce depth at the cost of more total gates through added operations. Conversely, serializing gates reduces count but increases depth. The optimal balance depends on hardware characteristics like coherence time versus gate fidelity."
What is the controlled-U gate?,A controlled-U gate applies an arbitrary single-qubit unitary U to the target when the control is 1. Any controlled-U can be decomposed into CNOTs and single-qubit gates. The decomposition requires two CNOTs and four single-qubit gates in general.
How do you decompose controlled-U into basic gates?,"Controlled-U decomposes as: A on target, CNOT, B on target, CNOT, C on target, where A, B, C are single-qubit gates satisfying ABC equals identity and U equals A times X times B times X times C. This uses two CNOTs for any controlled single-qubit gate."
What is a multiply-controlled gate?,A multiply-controlled gate applies an operation only when multiple control qubits are all in state 1. The Toffoli gate has two controls. More controls require ancilla qubits or deeper decompositions. These gates appear in arithmetic circuits and Grover iterations.
How do you implement multi-controlled gates efficiently?,"Multi-controlled gates can use ancilla qubits to reduce depth through parallelization. The V-chain decomposition computes control conjunctions into ancillas. Without ancillas, decomposition depth grows with control count. Various techniques trade off ancillas, depth, and gate count."
What is the V-chain decomposition?,"The V-chain efficiently implements multi-controlled gates using ancilla qubits. It sequentially computes AND of controls into ancillas using Toffoli gates, applies the controlled operation, then uncomputes. This reduces multi-controlled gates to a sequence of three-qubit operations."
What are relative phase Toffoli gates?,"Relative phase Toffoli gates implement the Toffoli action up to a phase that depends on input state. These simplified versions require fewer gates than exact Toffoli. When the phase is later canceled or irrelevant, relative phase versions offer efficiency gains."
What is the margolus gate?,"The Margolus gate is a simplified Toffoli that implements the controlled-controlled-NOT with fewer resources but adds a phase on certain inputs. It uses only three two-qubit gates compared to six for standard Toffoli. When phases cancel later, Margolus is preferred."
What are ancilla qubits in gate decomposition?,"Ancilla qubits are extra qubits used temporarily during computation to enable more efficient gate decompositions. They start in a known state, participate in the computation, and are returned to their initial state. More ancillas can reduce circuit depth."
What is the workspace-depth tradeoff?,"More ancilla workspace typically enables shallower circuits through parallelization. Conversely, limited ancillas force deeper sequential circuits. Algorithm designers balance available qubits against required circuit depth based on hardware constraints."

What is the difference between logical and physical gates?,Physical gates are operations directly implemented on hardware qubits. Logical gates operate on error-corrected logical qubits encoded in multiple physical qubits. Implementing logical gates requires careful sequences of physical gates that preserve error correction properties.
What are transversal gates?,Transversal gates apply physical gates to corresponding physical qubits of two logical qubits independently. They are automatically fault-tolerant because errors do not spread between qubits. Not all logical gates can be transversal for any given code.
Why can't all gates be transversal?,"The Eastin-Knill theorem proves no quantum error-correcting code has transversal implementations for a universal gate set. This fundamental limit means fault-tolerant universal computation requires techniques beyond transversal gates, like magic state distillation."

How does gate teleportation enable fault-tolerant T gates?,"A magic state encoding the T gate is prepared and distilled to high fidelity. Teleportation transfers the state while applying T to the logical qubit. The expensive distillation happens offline, enabling fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates."
What is a magic state?,A magic state is a specific quantum state that serves as a resource for implementing non-Clifford gates through gate teleportation. The T magic state enables fault-tolerant T gates. Preparing high-quality magic states requires distillation from many noisy copies.
What gates can be implemented transversally in the surface code?,"The surface code allows transversal implementation of Clifford gates including CNOT, H with code deformation, and Pauli gates. The T gate cannot be transversal and requires magic state injection. This pattern is common across CSS codes."
What is code switching for gate implementation?,Code switching transfers logical information between different error-correcting codes to access different transversal gates. One code might have transversal H while another has transversal T. Switching between codes enables universal computation with transversal gates.
What is gauge fixing in fault-tolerant gates?,Gauge fixing selects specific gauge configurations in subsystem codes to enable transversal gates. Different gauge choices make different gates transversal. Dynamically changing gauge is another approach to universal fault-tolerant computation.

How precise must gate synthesis be?,"Required precision depends on the algorithm and error correction threshold. For fault-tolerant computing, synthesis error should be below the code threshold. This typically means approximation to parts in a thousand or better, requiring tens to hundreds of T gates per rotation."

What is as-late-as-possible scheduling?,"ALAP scheduling delays gates to the latest possible time while meeting deadlines. This can reduce time qubits spend idle, minimizing decoherence for qubits used later in the circuit. ALAP complements ASAP by considering different optimization goals."
How does gate scheduling affect errors?,"Scheduling affects errors through idle decoherence, crosstalk from simultaneous gates, and gate-specific timing requirements. Optimal scheduling balances these factors. Poor scheduling can significantly degrade circuit fidelity even with high-quality individual gates."
What is gate parallelization?,Gate parallelization executes independent gates simultaneously to reduce circuit depth. Gates on non-overlapping qubits can often run in parallel. The degree of parallelization depends on hardware constraints like shared control lines and crosstalk.
What limits gate parallelization?,"Parallelization is limited by qubit connectivity, shared control resources, and crosstalk between simultaneous operations. Running two gates in parallel may introduce errors that would not occur sequentially. Characterizing these limitations enables safe parallelization."
What is gate routing?,"Gate routing maps logical gates to physical qubit locations, inserting SWAP operations when needed for connectivity. Good routing minimizes added SWAP overhead. Routing is essential when algorithms require interactions between non-adjacent qubits."
What is the SWAP overhead problem?,Limited connectivity requires SWAP gates to bring distant qubits together for two-qubit gates. SWAP overhead can dominate circuit cost for highly connected algorithms on sparse hardware. Minimizing SWAPs through clever routing and mapping is critical.
How does connectivity affect algorithm efficiency?,Higher connectivity reduces SWAP overhead since more qubit pairs can interact directly. Full connectivity eliminates routing overhead entirely. The mismatch between algorithm connectivity needs and hardware connectivity determines compilation efficiency.
What types of errors occur in quantum gates?,"Gate errors include coherent errors like over-rotation and frequency miscalibration, and incoherent errors like depolarization and dephasing. Leakage to non-computational states is another error type. Understanding error types guides mitigation strategies."
What is a coherent error?,"A coherent error is a systematic deviation from the intended operation, like rotating 181 degrees instead of 180. Coherent errors are predictable and can potentially be corrected through recalibration. They accumulate deterministically rather than randomly."
What is an incoherent error?,"An incoherent error is random, like probabilistic bit flips or dephasing. These errors arise from environmental noise and cannot be predicted for individual operations. Incoherent errors are described statistically and addressed through error correction."
How do coherent and incoherent errors differ in accumulation?,"Coherent errors can add constructively, potentially growing linearly or worse with circuit depth. Incoherent errors typically add in quadrature, growing as the square root of the number of operations. This makes coherent errors potentially more damaging for deep circuits."
What is over-rotation error?,Over-rotation occurs when a gate rotates further than intended. A gate meant to rotate 90 degrees might rotate 91 degrees. Over-rotation is a coherent error that can be corrected by recalibrating pulse amplitudes or durations.
What is under-rotation error?,Under-rotation is when a gate rotates less than intended. It has similar causes and remedies as over-rotation. Both result from imperfect calibration of control pulse parameters and can be identified through gate characterization.
What is frequency miscalibration error?,"Frequency miscalibration means the control frequency does not exactly match the qubit frequency. This causes the rotation axis to tilt from intended, mixing X and Z rotations. Tracking qubit frequency drift and adjusting control frequencies reduces this error."
What is off-resonance error?,"Off-resonance error occurs when control pulses are not exactly on resonance with the qubit transition. The qubit does not respond ideally, leading to reduced rotation fidelity and rotation axis errors. Precise frequency calibration minimizes off-resonance effects."

How is crosstalk mitigated?,"Crosstalk mitigation includes careful frequency assignment, compensation pulses that cancel crosstalk effects, scheduling to avoid simultaneous conflicting operations, and hardware improvements like better shielding. Software and hardware approaches both contribute."
What is always-on coupling error?,Always-on coupling between qubits causes unwanted interaction even when no gate is intended. ZZ coupling is a common example. The coupling accumulates phase errors during idle time and must be echoed or compensated.
What is idle error?,"Idle error is the decoherence and unwanted evolution that occurs while qubits wait for other operations. During idle periods, T1 decay, dephasing, and always-on couplings cause errors. Minimizing idle time improves circuit fidelity."

Temperature fluctuations cause frequency drift and calibration changes. Stable temperature improves gate consistency."
How does magnetic field noise affect gates?,Magnetic field fluctuations shift qubit frequencies through the Zeeman effect. This causes dephasing and calibration drift. Magnetic shielding and field-insensitive qubit encodings reduce sensitivity. Active field cancellation further improves stability.
What is charge noise and how does it affect gates?,"Charge noise from fluctuating electric fields affects qubits through charge sensitivity or spin-orbit coupling. It causes dephasing and gate errors. Modern transmon designs minimize charge sensitivity, but charge noise remains relevant for some qubit types."
What is flux noise?,"Flux noise is fluctuation in magnetic flux through superconducting loops. Flux-tunable qubits are sensitive to this noise, which causes frequency fluctuations and dephasing. Operating at flux sweet spots or using flux-insensitive designs reduces impact."
What is a sweet spot for qubit operation?,"A sweet spot is an operating point where the qubit frequency is insensitive to certain noise sources to first order. At a charge sweet spot, frequency does not change with small charge variations. Operating at sweet spots improves coherence."

Standard error models assume Markovian (memoryless) errors. Non-Markovian effects complicate error characterization and correction."
What is context-dependent error?,Context-dependent error means gate fidelity depends on surrounding operations or system history. A gate following different preceding gates may have different fidelity. Characterization should capture context dependence for accurate predictions.
What is leakage detection?,"Leakage detection identifies when qubits have transitioned outside the computational space. Since leaked qubits behave abnormally, detecting leakage enables correction or discarding bad shots. Specialized sequences or measurements reveal leakage."
What is leakage removal?,Leakage removal returns leaked qubits to the computational space. Techniques include active reset pulses targeting leaked states or waiting for natural decay. Regular leakage removal prevents accumulation that would degrade computation.
How does measurement affect gate errors?,Measurement can introduce back-action on unmeasured qubits through crosstalk or shared elements. Mid-circuit measurement must be isolated from continuing computation. Measurement-induced errors are characterized separately from gate errors.

The quantum gates create superposition and entanglement, allowing the computer to explore many possibilities simultaneously. The final measurement gives the answer, with the algorithm designed so correct answers are more likely to appear."
What is quantum parallelism?,"Quantum parallelism is the ability of quantum computers to evaluate many possibilities simultaneously thanks to superposition. When a qubit is in superposition, operations on it affect all possible states at once. This is different from classical parallel computing where you need separate processors for each calculation."

It's one of the most important gates for creating entanglement between qubits. Together with single-qubit gates, CNOT forms a universal set for quantum computation."
What is the Pauli-X gate?,"The Pauli-X gate is the quantum equivalent of a classical NOT gate. It flips a qubit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. On the Bloch sphere, it corresponds to a rotation of 180 degrees around the X axis. It's one of the fundamental single-qubit gates."
What is the Pauli-Z gate?,"The Pauli-Z gate leaves the 0 state unchanged but adds a phase flip to the 1 state. While this might seem like it does nothing since both states are still 0 and 1, the phase change affects how the qubit interferes with others. Phases are crucial in quantum algorithms."
What is quantum phase?,"Quantum phase is a property of quantum states that doesn't exist in classical physics. Two qubits can have the same probabilities of being measured as 0 or 1 but different phases. Phase differences determine how quantum states interfere with each other, which is essential for quantum algorithms."
What is the T gate?,"The T gate, also called the pi/8 gate, adds a specific phase to the qubit state. It's important because the combination of Hadamard, CNOT, and T gates forms a universal gate set. The T gate is also significant in quantum error correction, though it's challenging to implement fault-tolerantly."
What is quantum teleportation?,Quantum teleportation is a technique to transfer quantum information from one location to another using entanglement and classical communication. It doesn't transport matter or energy instantly - the quantum state is destroyed at the source and recreated at the destination. It's a key protocol in quantum communication.
Why can't quantum teleportation be used for faster-than-light communication?,"Although entanglement creates instant correlations across any distance, you cannot use it to send information faster than light.

What is entanglement swapping?,"Entanglement swapping is a technique where two particles that have never interacted become entangled through an intermediate measurement. If particle A is entangled with B, and B is entangled with C, a specific measurement on B can create entanglement between A and C. This is crucial for quantum networks."
What is quantum memory?,"Quantum memory is a device that can store quantum information for later retrieval.

What is readout error?,"Readout error occurs when measuring a qubit gives the wrong result. Even if a qubit is in state 0, measurement might incorrectly return 1 due to noise. Readout errors can be partially corrected through statistical techniques by measuring many times."
What is crosstalk in quantum computers?,"Crosstalk is unwanted interaction between qubits. When you perform an operation on one qubit, it might accidentally affect neighboring qubits. This is a significant source of errors in quantum computers, especially as systems scale up with more qubits packed together."
What is T1 time?,"T1 time, or relaxation time, measures how long a qubit in state 1 takes to decay to state 0 due to energy loss to the environment. Longer T1 times mean qubits can hold information longer. It's one of the key metrics for qubit quality."
